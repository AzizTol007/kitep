        <h2>And you could be confused why did I pick UX/UI design</h2>
        <h2>UX/UI Design:

            UX design focuses on improving user satisfaction by enhancing the usability and accessibility of digital
            products. This involves understanding user needs through research, organizing content effectively, designing
            intuitive interaction patterns, and testing prototypes for iterative improvements.

            UI design, on the other hand, concentrates on the visual aspects of the product interface. This includes
            selecting appropriate colors, typography, and layout to create a visually appealing and coherent design that
            reflects the brand identity. UI designers also ensure the interface is responsive and accessible across
            various devices and screen sizes.

            By combining UX and UI design principles, digital products can offer a seamless user experience that not
            only looks great but also functions intuitively, ultimately leading to higher user engagement and
            satisfaction.
